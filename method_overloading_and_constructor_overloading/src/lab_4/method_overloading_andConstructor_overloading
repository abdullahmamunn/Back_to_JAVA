###In this session we going to learn very important topic of oop, that is method overloading, boolean method and 
constructor overloading.



problem 01: Name of the problem: Create a java class physics which will have the following members, distance and
time (float types) and velocity, displacement, t1, v1, u1 and t2(double types). The constructor will print out 
the following message “We are calculating the values of speed, velocity, and time “. It will have method called 
motion which will use method overloading to calculate the values of speed, velocity and acceleration.

problem 02: Name of the Problem: Create a java class bankaccount which will have the following members , 
name(string type) , accountid(int type), accounttype(string type) , and balance (double type). 
It will have a constructor to initialize the values. The class will have boolean method named compare which 
will have an object as a parameter and it will check if the names, account ids, account types, and balances are same 
in three bank accounts. It will print true if same names, ids, types and balances exist in the bank accounts, 
otherwise it will print false.

problem 03: Name of the program: Create a class named 'Rectangle' with two data members- length and breadth and
a method to calculate the area, a method to calculate the perimeter, and a method to calculate the diagonal.
The class has three constructors which are: 
1 - having no parameter - values of both length and breadth are assigned zero. 
2 - having two numbers as parameters - the two numbers are assigned as length and breadth respectively. 
3 - having one number as parameter - both length and breadth are assigned that number. 
Now, create objects of the 'Rectangle' class having none, one and two parameters and print their areas, perimeters, and diagonals. (Hint- Use constructor overloading)
